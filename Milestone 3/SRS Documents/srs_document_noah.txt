Functional:
1) The system shall allow for a .txt file containing the program to be loaded into memory.
2) The system shall append an error value at the end of all programs.
3) The system shall perform addition between a value found in the accumulator and a value specified in memory.
4) The system shall perform subtraction between a value found in the accumulator and a value specified in memory.
5) The system shall perform multiplication between a value found in the accumulator and a value specified in memory.
6) The system shall perform division between a value found in the accumulator and a value specified in memory.
7) In the event that a mathematical operation results in a number with more than 4 digits, the system will truncate the number 
to 4 digits before returning it.
8) The system shall be able to branch to a location in the program if the last operation resulted in a positive number.
9) The system shall be able to branch to a location in the program if the last operation resulted in a negative number.
10) The system shall be able to branch to a location in the program if the last operation resulted in zero.
11) The system shall allow the value in the accumulator to be stored in memory.
12) The system shall allow values to be loaded from memory into the accumulator.
13) The system shall allow a user to input a value to be stored in memory.
14) The system shall allow the value in a memory address to be displayed to the screen.
15) The system shall raise a syntax error if an unrecognized operation occurs in the program.

Non-functional:

User Story 1: As a student, I want to load my BasicML documents into the UVSim and run them 
so that I can better understand machine language.

Use Case 1: Load document into UVSim
Actor: Student
System: UVSim
Student launches UVSim
Student selects the option to load a program
Student provides the path to the BasicML program file
UVSim reads the file and loads the program into memory
UVSim displays a confirmation message
Goal: Load a BasicML program into the UVSim memory

Use Case 2: Perform I/O operations(READ, WRITE)
Actor: Student
System: UVSim
Student loads the program into the UVSim memory which includes READ and WRITE instruction (“READ 12” or “WRITE 15” for example)
Student initiates the execution of the program
UVSim encounters the READ instruction thus prompting the student to input a word
The student inputs a word through the keyboard
UVSim stores the input word into specified memory location
UVSim encounters the WRITE instruction thus displaying to the screen the content of the specified memory location from before.
UVSim continues executing
Goal: Perform I/O operations using BasicML instructions (READ and WRITE)

Use Case 3: Execute BasicML programs
Actor: Student
Preconditions: The student must have already loaded a BasicML program into UVSim. 
System: UVSim
Student inputs the command to start program execution.
UVSim interprets the BasicML instructions one by one.
UVSim performs the specified operations (e.g., Read, Write, Add, etc).
UVSim displays the result of each instruction execution.
UVSim displays a message once the execution is complete
Goal: Execute the loaded BasicML program, interpreting and performing operations based on the program. 





User Story 2: As an educator, I want UVSim to be a good teaching tool for machine language concepts so that I can provide a quality education for my students.

Use Case 1: Teach Control Operation BRANCH
Actor: Educator
System: UVSim
Educator prepares and loads into UVSim a BasicML program that includes the control operation: BRANCH
Educator initiates program execution 
UVSim encounters BRANCH instruction 
UVSim directs the program to the specified location in memory
UVSim continues execution of other operations/instructions
UVSim reaches the end of the program and displays completion message
Goal: Demonstrate the control operations in BasicML for teaching purposes

Use Case 2: Demonstrate Control Operation BRANCHNEG, BRANCHZERO
Actor: Educator
System: UVSim
Educator prepares and loads into UVSim a BasicML program that includes the control operations: BRANCHNEG, BRANCHZERO
Educator initiates program execution 
UVSim encounters BRANCHNEG instruction
UVSim checks if accumulator is negative
If negative UVSim directs the program to the specified location in memory
UVSim continues execution of other operations/instructions
UVSim encounters BRANCHZERO instruction
UVSim checks if accumulator is = 0
If zero UVSim directs the program to the specified location in memory
UVSim continues execution of other operations/instructions
UVSim reaches the end of the program and displays completion message
Goal: Demonstrate the control operations BRANCHNEG and BRANCHZERO in BasicML for teaching purposes


Use Case 3: Demonstrate Control Operation HALT
Actor: Educator
System: UVSim
Educator prepares and loads into UVSim a BasicML program that includes the control operation: HALT
Educator initiates program execution 
UVSim executes the program and it’s instructions
UVSim encounters HALT instruction
UVSim halts execution of the program and exits. 
UVSim displays a completion message.
Goal: Demonstrate the control operation HALT in BasicML for teaching purposes

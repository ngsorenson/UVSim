Use case 1: Perform adding.
	Actor: student learning ML,
	System: UVSim (CPU),
	Goal: successfully add two numbers.

	-Student saves integer into memory.
	-Student loads a different integer into the accumulator.
	-Student runs add function, inputting the memory location and the accumulator.
	-UVSim returns the addition of the two integers.

Use case 2: Perform subtracting.
	Actor: student learning ML,
	System: UVSim (CPU),
	Goal: successfully subtract two numbers.

	-Student saves integer into memory.
	-Student loads a different integer into the accumulator.
	-Student runs subtract function, inputting the memory location and the accumulator.
	-UVSim returns the subtraction of the two integers.

Use case 3: Perform division.
	Actor: student learning ML,
	System: UVSim (CPU),
	Goal: successfully divide two numbers.

	-Student saves integer into memory.
	-Student loads a different integer into the accumulator.
	-Student runs divide function, inputting the memory location and the accumulator.
	-UVSim returns the division of the two integers.

Use case 4: Perform multiplication.
	Actor: student learning ML,
	System: UVSim (CPU),
	Goal: successfully multiply two numbers.

	-Student saves integer into memory.
	-Student loads a different integer into the accumulator.
	-Student runs multiply function, inputting the memory location and the accumulator.
	-UVSim returns the multiplication of the two integers.

Use case 5: Perform multiplication with overflow.
	Actor: professor teaching their students,
	System: UVSim (CPU),
	Goal: return an integer that is smaller than expected, error free.

	-Professor saves relatively large integer into memory.
	-Professor loads a different relatively integer into the accumulator.
	-Professor runs multiply function, inputting the memory location and the accumulator.
	-UVSim returns an integer that is smaller than the multiplication of those integers.

Use case 6: Perform division to show integer result when non-integer is expected.
	Actor: professor teaching their students,
	System: UVSim (CPU),
	Goal: return an integer when a non-integer is expected.

	-Professor saves an integer into memory.
	-Professor loads a different, smaller integer into the accumulator.
	-Professor runs division function, inputting the memory location and the accumulator.
	-UVSim returns 0, when a rational number was expected mathematically.
